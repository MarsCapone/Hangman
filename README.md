Hangman
=======

Simple text based Hangman game

=======

Just run hangman.py. 
There is a single player mode where the computer will choose a random word, or a two player option where player 1 can pick a word and the number of chances, and another player can guess. 
On the two player mode you can choose whether to have ascii art hangman on or off.

Requires Python 2.7

The program asks for a word list, if you don't have one, it will download the one found here: http://www.mieliestronk.com/corncob_lowercase.txt

I just decided to write this program one evening, when my cousin said she had to make the game for her programming class. It was initially going to be really simple, but I got a bit carried away.

Enjoy!
